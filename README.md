A [LESS] parser for [PostCSS].

**This module does not compile LESS.** It simply parses mixins as custom
at-rules & variables as properties, so that PostCSS plugins can then transform
LESS source code alongside CSS.

## Use Cases

* lint your LESS code with a plugin such as [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io/).
* apply PostCSS transformations (such as [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)) directly to the LESS source code

## Usage

### LESS Transformations

The main use case of this plugin is to apply PostCSS transformations directly
to LESS source code. For example, if you ship a theme written in LESS and need
[Autoprefixer] to add the appropriate vendor prefixes to it; or you need to
lint LESS with a plugin such as [Stylelint].

```js
const syntax = require('postcss-less');
postcss(plugins).process(lessText, { syntax: syntax }).then(function (result) {
    result.content // LESS with transformations
});
```

### Inline Comments for PostCSS

This module also enables parsing of single-line comments in CSS source code.

```less
:root {
    // Main theme color
    --color: red;
}
```

Note that you don't need a special stringifier to handle the output; the default
one will automatically convert single line comments into block comments.

## Restrictions

### Skipped blocks:
* nested mixins with custom token `nested-mixin`
* nested &:extend(); with custom token `nested-extend`

## Attribution

Current module is based on the work of [postcss-scss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss) library and includes the `LESS` parser efforts of [github:gilt/postcss-less](https://github.com/gilt/postcss-less) and [github:webschik/postcss-less](https://github.com/webschik/postcss-less)
